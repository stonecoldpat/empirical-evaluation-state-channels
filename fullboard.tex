\section{Battleship with Commitments to each Cell} 

In this Appendix, we provide an alternative design for the Battleship smart contract, in which the users commit to each cell of their Battleship board in addition to the commitments of their ships. For each cell, the commitment consists of the hash of a flag indicating whether the cell is occupied by a ship or by water and a random nonce for blinding.
The advantage of such a design is that cheating in some cases can be detected earlier. However, this comes with the drawback of a larger state and thus a more expensive smart contract execution, which is why our implementation uses the design presented in Section~\ref{sec:battleshipcontract}. Nevertheless, we want to describe the alternative here.

\subsection{Battleship Contract} 

We present each phase of the game, how to establish the contract, the cut-and-choose protocol to begin the game, the turn-based gameplay and finally how the loser is provided an opportunity to prove the winner cheated.

The \emph{Game Phases} and \emph{Contract establishment} are equal to the design of the game in Section~\ref{sec:battleshipcontract}.

\paragraph{Prepare boards} Both parties participate in a cut-and-choose protocol during $\gamestatus := \gamesetup$. 
A ship hash is denoted as $\hship := \hash(i,j,i\pm,j\pm,r, \mathsf{round}, \participant, \appcontract)$ where $i,j$ represents its initial position, $i\pm,j\pm$ represents its final position. 
All cells between  $i,j$ and $i\pm,j\pm$ should be marked as ship locations, i.e. for each of these cells, each player $\participant$ creates a commitment $\hcell := \hash(1,r, \mathsf{round}, \participant, \appcontract)$ while for all other (i.e. water) cells, the player creates a commitment $\hcell := \hash(0,r, \mathsf{round}, \participant, \appcontract)$, where $x,y$ are the coordinates of the cell, $r$ is a fresh random nonce. The cell commitments are ordered deterministically by their indices.
Each party computes and signs $N$ lists of ships and cell commitments: 

\begin{displaymath}
 \Sigma_{1}^{N} := \sign_{\participant}(((k_{i,1},\hship_{i,1}),...,(k_{i,n},\hship_{i,n})), (\hcell_{i,1},...,\hcell_{i,m}), \participant, \mathsf{round}, \appcontract)
\end{displaymath}
 
Each ship in a list is denoted as $(k,\hship)$, where $k$ is the length for that particular ship.  
This is sent to the counterparty who is responsible for selecting one list and reserving it for the game by submitting it alongside the corresponding signature using $\battleshipselectboard$. 
The party must open the remaining $N-1$ list of ships and cell commitments to the counterparty who can check their validity. 
If satisified, each party notifies the contract to begin the game using $\battleshipbegin$ which is an explicit acknowledgement that each party has reviewed all opened list of ships.
If the counter-party does not open any ship lists, then the party can signal their desire to quit  using $\battleshipgameover$.
Finally the game $\mathsf{round}$ is incremented regardless if it continues or not. 

\paragraph{Game-play}
The contract maintains a counter $\mathsf{move}$ which is incremented after each player's turn. 
In the $\gameattack$ phase, the player challenges the counterparty to open a cell $i,j$ by signing: 

\begin{center}
	$\sigma^{shot}_{\participant} := \sign_{\participant}(i,j, \mathsf{move}, \mathsf{round},\appcontract)$ \\
\end{center}

This message is submitted using $\battleshipattackcell$.
It transitions the game phase to $\gamereveal$ and sets a fixed time period $\timechallenge := \timenow + \timerchallenge$ for the counterparty's response. 
The counterparty signs one of two messages depending on whether a ship was sunk:

\begin{center}
	$\sigma^{hit}_{\participant} := \sign_{\participant}(i,j,b,r_{c},\mathsf{move}, \mathsf{round},\appcontract)$ \\ $\sigma^{sunk}_{\participant} := \sign_{\participant}(i,j,i\pm,j\pm,r_{c}, r_{s},\hship,\mathsf{move}, \mathsf{round},\appcontract)$
\end{center}

The counterparty is responsible for submitting either signed message. 
The first message declares if the cell is marked with water $b=0$ or a ship location $b=1$.
It is submitted using $\battleshiprevealcell$.
The second message declares the shot sank a ship and requires the counterparty to open the corresponding ship commitment $\hship$ to $\battleshipsinking$.  The battleship contract then checks whether the commitment to the cell corresponds to what the counterparty revealed, i.e. if the commitment is a commitment to $b$ (where $b=1$ in case $\sigma^{sunk}_{\participant}$ is sent), given the nonce $r_{c}$. If the ship is sunk, the contract also verifies that the revealed locations corresponds to one of the ship commitments given nonce $r_{s}$.
Each party must keep a copy of every signed message\footnote{Every signed message is emitted by the contract and thus it is easily fetchable.} as it can later be used to prove fraud which we discuss in Section \ref{sec:prooffraud}.
The game transitions to $\gamewinner$ if one player has declared all their ships sunk. 

Finally the \emph{End of game} is again as described in Section~\ref{sec:battleshipcontract}. 

\subsection{Checking for Fraud}

In addition to the integrity checks presented in Section~\ref{sec:fraud} (\emph{Exceeded maximum number of moves}, \emph{Players only play using valid cells}, \emph{A ship was not placed horizontally or vertically}) that are performed in the same way, the cell commitments also allow checking for \emph{False Cell Reveal}, i.e. the contract ensures that a player cannot claim that a cell contains water if it in fact contains a ship by checking that the reveal matches the cell commitment (as described above). This allows ending a game early if a player tries to cheat by revealing false information about a cell. In our main version without cell commitments this could only be detected and punished at the end of the game.

\subsection{Proof of Fraud}  \label{sec:prooffraud}

The fraud proofs for this version of the game are the same as the ones given in Section~\ref{sec:prooffraud} with the exception of \emph{Counterparty was dishonest about a cell opening}, which is not available/required in this version, since this is already checked during gameplay as described above.
