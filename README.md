# In the Spirit of Open-Source
We received funding from the community (Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Community Fund) to support the research/implementation of state channels. In the spirit of this funding (and the open-source community), we kept our experiment open-source while it was in progress and we presented whenever possible about our on-going results. To complete this transparency, we have decided to make the github repository for our paper public as well.

Hopefully by making the experiment and paper-writing open source, it will serve as a useful reference to new PhD students and the wider-community about how ideas change when a person is forced to write it down/when new evidence becomes available. After all, papers are about adding to the wider-discussion and not about being “right”.

A blog for the paper can be found here:

We'll continue updating our paper here as new results (or insights) come in.
